# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major milestones for building and validating the MCP server name bias experiment.

## Milestones

1. **Bootstrap Environment**  
   - Provide base files (`server_schema.json`, `name_factors.csv`, `prompts/`).
   - Implement server deployment and request dispatch scripts.

2. **Pilot Study**  
   - Test core factors (CompanyType, Suffix, MatchModelBrand) on a small prompt subset.  
   - Verify logging and randomization mechanisms.

3. **Full Factorial Run**  
   - Expand to the complete set of naming factors.  
   - Collect â‰¥3,000 samples per model.

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Perform logistic regression and bias significance tests.  
   - Generate figures and intermediate report.

5. **Replication & Extension**  
   - Re-run with additional domains or models.  
   - Draft final paper and recommendations.
